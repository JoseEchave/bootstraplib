# bootstraplib

The **bootstraplib** R package provides a foundation for other packages (e.g., **shiny**, **rmarkdown**, etc) or other projects to:

* Use [Bootstrap](https://sass-lang.com/) 4, as well as any major version of Bootstrap built on [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). 

  * Packages like **shiny**, **rmarkdown**, and many of their downstream dependencies have long depended on static Bootstrap 3 CSS, and may continue to do so by default. This package provides a means for upgrading to Bootstrap 4 (as well as compiling [Bootstrap 3 SASS](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass), and potentially, [future major versions](https://github.com/twbs/release) of Bootstrap). 

* Easily use pre-packaged [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) themes. 

* Create [custom Bootstrap themes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming) through compilation of user supplied [Sass](https://Sass-lang.com) code from R. 

To learn more, see the article on using **bootstraplib** with [**shiny**](articles/shiny.html) and [**rmarkdown**](articles/rmarkdown.html), as well as creating [custom Bootstrap themes](articles/custom.html).
